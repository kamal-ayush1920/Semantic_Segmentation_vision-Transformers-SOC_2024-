Assignments and all learning are kept here

Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific class/category, effectively dividing the image into segments or regions based on the semantic meaning of the objects present. Semantic segmentation is crucial in various applications, including autonomous driving, medical image analysis, satellite image analysis, and more. 
 
 Our project will revolve around Brain Image Segmentation or Microscope Image Segmentation depending on the interests of the mentees. This will be a intermediate+ level project. We expect decent programming skills and familiarity with implementing basic machine learning models like Neural Networks. We will discuss the projects in slack.
